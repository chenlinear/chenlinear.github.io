RSS, personal website and the word "neat" shared a lot in common, one of which is that they died out at the beginning of this century but have become more useful ever since.

## ยง1 Why?

The whole goal of RSS is to keep it simple. I don't want to check a lot of websites over and over again. Something should be read and then forgotten, unless it's important, in which case I will mark it down.

## ยง2 How?

My requirements:

- multi-platform.
- browser extension or website.
- don't have to open a server myself.

The free service of [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is fine with me, you can

- add RSS link. For example, https://chenlinear.github.io/atom.xml
- search for the people you want to follow.

For what's not there (say social media account), try [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/). But I have to say that you need to open your own server to get it work smoothly, because some of the URLs they provided do not work all the time. I want to cut down social media anyway, so this might be a good thing.

Also, [Building your personal RSS on GitHub](https://yufree.cn/cn/2018/03/24/blogdown-rss/) is fun, but I don't want to repeat what I have done for the personal website all over again.
