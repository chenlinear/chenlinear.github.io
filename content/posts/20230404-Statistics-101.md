Before do the math, here's things you should consider to avoid [bias](https://chenli2049.github.io/posts/20230304-book-review-lost-in-math/):

- The magnitude of axis. $\log$? 2 quantities use separate axises? Dramatic?
- Duration of time. "Every Olympic is the best Olympic in the last 3 years."
- Demography. Age, wealth, gender, race, etc. Does it cover all the target demography?
- From what media or institution. Different media have different biases themselves. (Although this statement is also a kind of bias.) For a more detailed research, see [_Machine-Learning media bias_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00024).

Here's some examples of bad (or maybe good in some sense?) axis:

Also, Simpson's paradox is interesting. But I'm not sure if it's a mental thing.
