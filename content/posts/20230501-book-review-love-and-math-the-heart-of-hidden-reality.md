This is a review of [_Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality_](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Math-Heart-Hidden-Reality/dp/0465050743) by [Edward Frenkel](https://www.edwardfrenkel.com/).

This book is about love, or [Langlands program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langlands_program)[^1], or the generality of group theory, or [beauty](https://chenlinear.github.io/posts/20230304-book-review-lost-in-math/). Most of the content feels like text book to me, such as Discrete Groups, Group Representation, etc.

Unlike physics, it's much harder to write math popularization. I can quickly get what he is talking about because I'm learning Group Theory this semester. Without the theorems and equations I learned, I would have a much more vague idea of the content in the book. But anyway, the purpose of popularization is always get the reader to learn the real thing. I just did the latter one first.

Math is beautiful and touching even, but physics is not, physics is messy and realistic. I mean, I'm still interested in and constantly amazed by all kinds of connections, even tiny and trivial ones, see [_Î´_](https://chenlinear.github.io/posts/20230314-delta-function/). But connections are lack in real world, because people play different games in different aspects of life, see [_Book review: Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius_](https://chenlinear.github.io/posts/20230312-book-review-ludwig-wittgenstein-the-duty-of-genius/). We have talked about Quantum Gravity for a really long time, yet here we are.

The story in chapter 2 is heartbroken. I'm sorry that it happened to him or anybody. His experience reminds of this quote:

>You are the captain of your own ship. You have the power at any moment to CHOOSE. Make sure you're choosing from a place of your vision and not in reaction to the circumstances that present themselves.

And when you did choose, work harder.
