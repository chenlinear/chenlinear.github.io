I created a repository called [PEP-8-ZH](https://github.com/chenlinear/PEP-8-ZH). Basically, I translated [_PEP 8_](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) with the help of ChatGPT, and with a little modification myself. The prompt that I use is:

```bash
将下文翻译为中文
```

And I did not translate the comments, because you should try to write comments in English.

If you want to learn about Python style, I recommend [_Google Style Guides_](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) (中文版见 [_Google 开源项目风格指南_](https://zh-google-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) as the guide. Which is more up to date. I'll write about Python style soon.
