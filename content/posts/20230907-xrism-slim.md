X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is an X-ray space telescope. On the same rocket there's also Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM), a moon landing project.

XRISM's predecessor Hitomi was launched on February 17 2016 and contact was lost on March 26 2016, due to malfunction of the attitude control system. (I always tell people to control their attitude btw.) After which, a lot changed. For example, [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01611) explained the team management of XRISM, which is like an analogue of government system.

And here's a [presentation](https://github.com/chenlinear/chenlinear/blob/main/presentations/20220815_G1Presentation_XRISM.pptx) from my group project last summer, which is a quick introduction to XRISM. I do (not) miss using Microsoft PPT, those were simpler times.

It's a bit weird that writing about something makes you care about it more. I mean, I did not participate in the manufacturing process or anything. I guess this is also one of the meanings of this blog.

XRISM, hang in there! Wow this is a pun. So, um ... SLIM, don't?

And this is the title screen of _Kerbal Space Program_ by the way:
