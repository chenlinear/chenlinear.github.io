It's wild all of these are happening so fast!

On my local computer:
- I updated Jupyter Notebook to v7.0.3, and my post [_Conda 101_](https://chenlinear.github.io/posts/20230327-conda-101/) is updated.

On the server:
- CUDA version is now `11.7` and reaches the minimum requirement of `torch 2.0`.
- `Mojo` can be installed locally now, see [Mojo ðŸ”¥Â available for local download!](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/discussions/568)

Just imagine the speed! Installing process is gonna be hell, but I'm ready to go.
