In the following article I will focus on the model rather than how to load the data or how to train the model with pytorch-lightning, and I will test these models with dummies. Because I just understand things better in this way and I haven\u0026rsquo;t used these models in practice.\nAnd my notes are in GitHub repository blog-graphnet. In order to be actually used, the models in §3.2 and §3.3 need to be followed by a Fully Connected Layer.\n§3.1 Shape of the Data See 4. The Dataset and DataLoader classes of the getting started document:\ngraph.x: Node feature matrix with shape [num_nodes, num_features] graph.edge_index: Graph connectivity in COO format with shape [2, num_edges] and type torch.long (by default this will be None, i.e., the nodes will all be disconnected). §3.2 ConvNet graphnet.models.gnn.ConvNet is based on torch_geometric.nn.TAGConv. For the structure of the model, see Fig.3 of [2107.12187] Reconstruction of Neutrino Events in IceCube using Graph Neural Networks.\nIn line 46:\nself.conv1 = TAGConv(self.nb_inputs, self.nb_intermediate, 2) This means that Number of hops $K=2$. When $K=1$, GNN only considers the information of directly adjacent nodes. When $K=2$, GNN takes into account the information of first-order and second-order adjacent nodes. When $K=3$, GNN considers the information of first-order, second-order, and third-order adjacent nodes, and so on. Of course, after few TAGConv layers, the output can gather the information of more than second-order adjacent of the original graph.\nIn [2107.12187], it\u0026rsquo;s stated that:\nIn the simplest way, each pulse can be described by following quantities: the hit DOM, and therefore the position of the pulse, collected charge, and time recorded. \u0026hellip; We can then represent each event by a graph, with the nodes representing the pulses in an abstract 5-dimensional (or 12-dimensional for the Upgrade) space.\nTherefore, the event is an input matrix in the shape of [number_of_pulses, 5], where 5 is x, y, z, time, charge.\n§3.3 DynEdge §3.3.1 DynEdgeConv The basic layer of DynEdge is graphnet.models.components.layers.DynEdgeConv, which is based on torch_geometric.nn.EdgeConv.\n§3.3.2 DynEdge graphnet.models.gnn.DynEdge\n§3.3.3 DynEdgeJINST graphnet.models.gnn.DynEdgeJINST is the model in Fig.2 of [2209.03042] Graph Neural Networks for Low-Energy Event Classification \u0026amp; Reconstruction in IceCube. [n, 6] in the figure means the number of nodes is n and the number of features is 6, while [1, n_outputs] means the prediction of this event has n_outputs features (azimuth, zenith, energy, etc.)\n§3.3.4 DynEdgeTITO graphnet.models.gnn.DynEdgeTITO is from 1st Place Solution | Kaggle.\nAn modification for torch_geometric.nn.EdgeConv is $$x_i^{\\prime} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} h_{\\mathbf{\\Theta}}(x_i , x_j - x_i)$$ to $$x_i^{\\prime} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} h_{\\mathbf{\\Theta}}(x_i , x_j - x_i , x_j)$$\nAnd this solution also uses custom VMF Loss (not in graphnet.models.gnn.DynEdgeTITO of course): $$\\text{VMF}=- \\kappa \\cos{\\theta}+C(\\kappa)$$ to $$\\text{VMF}= - \\theta - \\kappa \\cos{\\theta}+C(\\kappa)$$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between truth and prediction, $\\kappa$ is the length of the 3D prediction.\n§3.4 Model \u0026amp; StandardModel graphnet.models.Model and graphnet.models.StandardModel are wrappers choosing models and goals.\n","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eTechnically this is only part of the entire blog post.

So please always check the official documents.\nThe following content is based on what happened in a .ipynb file, to run a .mojo or .🔥 file, see Build and run Mojo source files.\n§1 Mojo Language Basics This is my notes from Mojo language basics and Mojo programming manual.\nMojo’s standard library has not yet grown a standard list or dictionary type and list or dict comprehensions is not supported. See Roadmap \u0026amp; sharp edges. See Mojo modules for all the APIs. You can use %%python at the top of a notebook cell and write normal Python code. Variables, functions, and imports defined in a Python cell are available for access in subsequent Mojo cells. §1.1 var \u0026amp; let You can declare variables with var to create a mutable value, or with let to create an immutable value. Although types aren\u0026rsquo;t required, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to do so. You can check all the types in Mojo at Modular Docs - int or Modular Docs - dtype. For example:\nvar a = 1 var b: Int = 1 let c = 1 let d: Int = 1 let e: Float64 = 1.0 Always do these declaration at the beginning of code, because:\nRedefining implicit variables is not supported (variables without a let or var in front). If you’d like to redefine a variable across notebook cells, you must introduce the variable with var (let variables are immutable). You can’t use global variables inside functions—they’re only visible to other global variables. §1.2 fn fn is similar to def in Python. And Mojo supports def too. Types are required for arguments and return values for a fn function.\n§1.2.1 Immutable Arguments: borrowed If the arguments of the function are immutable: fn add(borrowed x: Int, borrowed y: Int) -\u0026gt; Int: return x + y c = add(1, 2) print(c) will get: 3 §1.2.2 Mutable Arguments: inout If the arguments are mutable: fn add_inout(inout x: Int, inout y: Int) -\u0026gt; Int: x += 1 y += 1 return x + y var a = 1 var b = 2 c = add_inout(a, b) print(a) print(b) print(c) will get (Note that a and b has changed): 2 3 5 §1.2.3 Transfer Arguments: owned \u0026amp; ^ If the arguments are immutable but you still want to modify it without affecting variables outside the function (This is normally what would happen in Python that global variables (variables outside the function) won\u0026rsquo;t change.)\nfn add_owned(owned x: Int, owned y: Int) -\u0026gt; Int: x += 1 y += 1 return x + y let a = 1 # or var a = 1 let b = 2 # or var b = 2 c = add_owned(a, b) print(a) print(b) print(c) will get:\n1 2 5 or\nfn add_owned(owned x: Int, owned y: Int) -\u0026gt; Int: x += 1 y += 1 return x + y c = add_owned(1, 2) print(c) will get:\n5 ^ will destroy local variable (variable inside the fn):\nfn add_owned(owned x: Int, owned y: Int) -\u0026gt; Int: x += 1 y += 1 return x+y fn main(): let a: Int = 1 # or var a = 1, this will get a warning to suggest using let because a is never mutated let b: Int = 2 let c: Int # late initialization c = add_owned(a^, b^) print(a) print(b) print(c) main() will get an error at print(a) because a has been destroyed. And\nfn add_owned(owned x: Int, owned y: Int) -\u0026gt; Int: x += 1 y += 1 return x+y fn main(): let a: Int = 1 # or var a = 1, this will get a warning to suggest using let because a is never mutated let b: Int = 2 let c: Int # late initialization c = add_owned(a^, b^) # print(a) # print(b) print(c) main() will get:\n5 In summary, in practice I will probably:\nuse Transfer Arguments (owned and ^) start by writing var and then change it into let according to the warning. §1.3 struct struct is similar to class in Python:\nstruct MyPair: var first: Int var second: Int fn __init__(inout self, first: Int, second: Int): self.first = first self.second = second fn dump(self): print(self.first, self.second) let mine = MyPair(2, 4) mine.dump() will get:\n2 4 §1.4 Python packages from python import Python let np = Python.import_module(\u0026#34;numpy\u0026#34;) let pd = Python.import_module(\u0026#34;pandas\u0026#34;) let plt = Python.import_module(\u0026#34;matplotlib.pyplot\u0026#34;) ar = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5) print(ar) print(ar.shape) will get:\n[[ 0 1 2 3 4] [ 5 6 7 8 9] [10 11 12 13 14]] (3, 5) §2 Other Documents Mojo programming manual explains why Mojo is designed in this way. I will look it up when facing bugs. I learned C++ years ago and I haven\u0026rsquo;t really learned Rust. I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar with Lifetime, Pointer, etc.\nModular AI Engine is about Modular AI Engine, which is not publicly available yet.\n","content_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emojonization\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cem\u003en.\u003c/em\u003e the migration and translation from Python to Mojo, the superset of Python.

Thus IceCube is the most sensitive to astrophysical sources in the Northern sky. However, the Galactic Center, as well as the bulk of the neutrino emission expected from the Galactic plane, is located in the Southern sky. This problem is solved by choosing cascade events instead of track events.\n§3 Method §3.1 Deep Learning CNN: choose the cascade event. It\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to use convolutional core to distinguish two different types of event. Which is generally use to detect cats (or a certain object) in a dataset of a lot of different pictures.\nNN with symmetries (that smoothly approximates a Monte Carlo simulation): refine event properties.\n§3.2 Template diffuse emission from the entire galaxy. Interactions between cosmic rays (high-energy protons and heavier nuclei) from the Milky Way and galactic gas/dust produce $\\pi$. An accelerated hadron will interact with other hadron or $\\gamma$-ray: $$N+N\u0026rsquo;,\\gamma \\rightarrow X+ \\begin{cases} \\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\nu_{\\mu} \\rightarrow e^+ \\nu_{\\mu} \\nu_{\\mu} \\nu_e \\left( + \\text{c.c.} \\right) \\\\ \\pi^0 \\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma \\end{cases} \\tag{1}$$ We expect both types to be produced together.\nTemplate: a background-only model for the expected flux of neutrinos over the entire Galactic plane, based on $\\gamma$-ray observation. $3$ template in total:\nOne made from extrapolating Fermi-LAT $\\gamma$-ray observations of the Milky Way (called $\\pi^0$. power law, $E^{-2.7}$).

Here\u0026rsquo;s some recommended review articles: [1901.06785] Probing supermassive black hole mergers and stalling with pulsar timing arrays, [2211.05148] Seeing the gravitational wave universe. Well, NANOGrav released a lot of papers on the same day: 2306.16223, 2306.16222, 2306.16221, 2306.16220, 2306.16219, 2306.16218, 2306.16217, 2306.16215, 2306.16213. The most important of which is probably [2306.16213] The NANOGrav 15-year Data Set: Evidence for a Gravitational-Wave Background, in which the dataset, method, validation are explained. I\u0026rsquo;ll charge into all the technical details when I have the time. And there\u0026rsquo;re more papers from different observatories, including Parkes Pulsar Timing Array, European Pulsar Timing Array (combined with Indian Pulsar Timing Array) and Chinese Pulsar Timing Array.\nThe general idea is:\nPulsars are accurate. The pulse delays (caused by GW) between two pulsars should be correlated according to their angular separation in the sky, which is called the Hellings and Downs correlation. LIGO observes Gravitational Wave (GW) with the wavelength of $30 \\text{Hz} - 7 \\text{kHz}$, caused by merges of Block Holes few times heavier than the sun, while NANOGrav observes GW with the wavelength of $10^{-9} \\text{Hz}$ (thus the name), caused by source unknown, probably merges of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH). LIGO is few kilometers long, while pulsars can be few lightyears away, which is in accordance to the fact that GW can only be detected by things close to its magnitude of wavelength.\nIt could be a window to the early universe, earlier than Cosmic Microwave Background. Because the current SMBH theory does not explain it very well. The higher frequency region of Figure 1. (a) of [2306.16213] looks like system error.\nDetecting GW with radio telescope through the observation of Pulsars Timing Array (PTA) is like how pregnant women start to see other pregnant women everywhere — Different people see different aspects of the whole picture: GW people see GW, radio telescope people see radio telescope.

I will get to this some day, but since in physics we are dealing with quite different dataset than Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Computer Vision (CV), it\u0026rsquo;s probably not gonna be really helpful.

The FULL list is one of the greatest human achievements.\nI think the best way to learn finite group is to start from various examples.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some general rules:\nSome rules to calculate permutations: $(12)=(21)$, $(123)=(231)=(312)$ $(12)(23)=(123)$ $(12)^{-1}=(21)=(12)$, $(123)^{-1}=(321)$, $((12)(34))^{-1}=(43)(21)$, $((123)(45))^{-1}=(54)(321)$. The structure of the permutation is the same, the numbers in the permutation goes backwards. $(12)(12)=e$ To calculate $((12)(34))(123)((12)(34))^{-1}$, first exchange $1$ and $2$ for $(123)$, than exchange $3$ and $4$. $(123)\\xrightarrow{\\text{exchange 1 and 2}}(213)\\xrightarrow{\\text{exchange 3 and 4}}(214)$ For a $S_n$ group, permutations with the same structure form a conjugate class. The number of elements in a conjugate class is a factor of the order of the group. The order of the subgroup is a factor of the order of the group. An invariant subgroup must consist of several complete conjugate classes. §1.1 C2 In the notation of permutation, $$C_2 = \\lbrace e, (12) \\rbrace \\tag{1.1.1}$$It has $2$ conjugate classes: $$\\begin{aligned} \\zeta_1\u0026amp;=\\lbrace e \\rbrace \\\\ \\zeta_2\u0026amp;=\\lbrace (12) \\rbrace \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.1.2}$$thus only has $2$ trivial invariant subgroups: $$\\begin{aligned} H_1 \u0026amp;= \\lbrace e\\rbrace \\\\ H_2\u0026amp;=\\lbrace e, (12) \\rbrace (C_2 \\space \\text{itself}) \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.1.3}$$thus has $2$ quotient groups, which are trivial: $$\\begin{aligned} C_2 / H_1 \u0026amp;= \\lbrace H_1, (12)H_1 \\rbrace \\cong C_2 \\\\ C_2 / H_2 \u0026amp;= \\lbrace H_2\\rbrace \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.1.4}$$\nIn the character table, the first row is always all $1$, and the first column is always the dimension $n_{\\mu}$ of the irreducible representation (irr. rep.) of the group, which satisfies $$n_G = \\sum n_{\\mu}^2 \\tag{1.1.5}$$where $n_G$ is the order of original group, in this case $C_2$. So the character table is:\nConjugate Class: $\\zeta_1$ $\\zeta_2$ 1 $1$ $1$ 2 $1$ $x$ According to orthonormality, the $1^{\\text{st}}$ row and the $2^{\\text{nd}}$ row satisfy (the coefficient ahead is $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{the number of elements in the conjugate class}}{n_G}}$ that each column has the same value):$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot1 \u0026amp; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot1 \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot x \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\tag{1.1.6}$$so $x=-1$, thus complete the character table:\nConjugate Class: $\\zeta_1$ $\\zeta_2$ 1 $1$ $1$ 2 $1$ $-1$ §1.2 C3 $$C_3 = \\lbrace e, (123), (321) \\rbrace \\tag{1.2.1}$$It has $3$ conjugate classes: $$\\begin{aligned} \\zeta_1\u0026amp;=\\lbrace e \\rbrace \\\\ \\zeta_2\u0026amp;=\\lbrace (123) \\rbrace \\\\ \\zeta_3\u0026amp;=\\lbrace (321) \\rbrace \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.2.2}$$thus only has $2$ trivial invariant subgroups: $$\\begin{aligned} H_1 \u0026amp;= \\lbrace e\\rbrace \\\\ H_2\u0026amp;=\\lbrace e, (123), (321) \\rbrace (C_3 \\space \\text{itself}) \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.2.3}$$thus has $2$ quotient groups, which are trivial: $$\\begin{aligned} C_3 / H_1 \u0026amp;= \\lbrace H_1, (123)H_1, (321)H_1 \\rbrace \\cong C_3 \\\\ C_3 / H_2 \u0026amp;= \\lbrace H_2\\rbrace \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.2.4}$$\nAccording to Eq.

This is an outline, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to keep it as simple as possible. You can import these layers and blocks from torch.nn, see Transformer Layers — PyTorch 2.0 documentation. And I will focus more on structure rather than code itself, because building this model on torch.nn is much simpler, see Language Modeling with nn.Transformer and torchtext — PyTorch Tutorials 2.0.1+cu117 documentation.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output \u0026hellip; the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.\nRecurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and gated RNNs have these shortages:\nThey handle sequence word-by-word, which is hard to be parallelized. They are easy to forget a long sequence or mix previous content up with following content. Attention mechanism has been used before, but Transformer is a pure attention architecture, that\u0026rsquo;s why \u0026ldquo;Attention is All You Need\u0026rdquo;.\n§1 Self-Attention $$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Softmax}(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}})V \\tag{1}$$where for a vector $\\vec{z_i}$, $$\\text{Softmax}(\\vec{z_i}) = \\frac{e^{\\vec{z_i}}}{\\sum_{i=0}^N e^{\\vec{z_i}}} \\tag{2}$$\nFor input $X$, to get $Q$ (Query), $K$ (Key), $V$ (Value), $$\\begin{aligned} Q \u0026amp;= XW^Q \\\\ K \u0026amp;= XW^K \\\\ V \u0026amp;= XW^V \\end{aligned} \\tag{3}$$where $W^Q$, $W^K$, $W^V$ are training parameters.\n§2 Multi-Head Attention For the same input $X$, define different $W^Q_i$, $W^K_i$, $W^V_i$, we will get different $$\\text{head}_i = \\text{Attention} (QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i) \\tag{4}$$$i =1, \\cdots, h$. And concat them together, multiply with training parameter $W^0$, we will get $$\\text{MultiHead} (Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1, \\cdots, \\text{head}_h) W^0 \\tag{5}$$see this picture:\nThis is the explanation for Figure 2 in Attention Is All You Need.\nAttention is Encoder-Decoder structure:\nFor a sentence with different $pos$ (up to $dim_{base}$, the maximum length of a sentence), and $j \\in [0,d_{model}]$, where $d_{model}$ is the length of the representation vector (in this case $4$, see the picture below). The Positional Embedding is $$\\begin{aligned} PE_{(pos, 2j)} \u0026amp;= \\sin(\\frac{pos}{ 10000^{2j/{d_{model}}}}) \\\\ PE_{(pos, 2j + 1)} \u0026amp;= \\cos(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2j/{d_{model}}}}) \\end{aligned} \\tag{6}$$Embedding is representation of discrete variables (in this case words or sub-words) by continuous (at least more continuous) vectors. It is possible to use nn.Embedding and get relatively the same result. Also, using $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ fits with Add \u0026amp; Norm layer where the inputs are normalized to $1$.\nThe Encoder will put the Embedding and Positional Embedding together to get the input $X$, see picture below:\n$X$ go through Encoder will get intermediate output $C$.\nAnd for Decoder:\nFor Multi-Head Attention, The input of Decoder is $X$ and $C$. For Masked Multi-Head Attention, The input of Decoder is masked $X$ and $C$. This model will predict the $i^{\\text{th}}$ word based on $0^{\\text{th}}$ to ${(i-1)}^{\\text{th}}$ word.\n§3 Transformer The structure of the full Transformer is:\n§3.1 Add \u0026amp; Norm Add is similar to learning residual functions proposed by ResNet. By introducing \u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;identity mapping\u0026rdquo;, the transformed input is added together with input by using a $1 \\times 1$ convolutional layer. Norm is normalization layer. §3.2 Feed Forward Composed of two Fully Connected Layers. The $1^\\text{st}$ layer is ReLU activation function$$\\text{ReLU}(x)=\\max{(0,x)} \\tag{7}$$ The $2^\\text{nd}$ layer is $$\\text{FFN}(X)=(\\max{(0,XW_1+b_1)})W_2+b_2 \\tag{8}$$ The output of Feed Forward will have the same dimension with input $X$.

Using the samples in the Bernoulli distribution, some elements of the input tensor are randomly zeroed with probability $p$.

This is more useful when building a simple neural network.\nFor example, to construct a model with a 2d convolution layer, a ReLU layer and a 2d convolution layer:\nmodel = nn.Sequential( nn.Conv2d(1, 20, 5), nn.ReLU(), nn.Conv2d(20, 64, 5), ) x = torch.randn(1, 1, 30, 30) y = model(x) print(y.shape) will get:\ntorch.Size([1, 64, 22, 22]) The Smallest Framework In practice, the whole project often looks like this:\n├── data │ ├── processed │ └── raw ├── src │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── config.json │ ├── loss.py │ ├── models.py │ └── utils.py ├── LICENSE ├── predict.py ├── prepare_dataset.py ├── README.md ├── requirements.txt └── train.py But this is just a simple model, so it\u0026rsquo;s just one file.\nclass MyNetwork(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() # Define every layer self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1) self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1) self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 32 * 32, 128) self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10) def forward(self, x): # Define forward propagation x = F.relu(self.conv1(x)) x = F.relu(self.conv2(x)) x = x.view(x.size(0), -1) x = F.relu(self.fc1(x)) x = self.fc2(x) return x model = MyNetwork() criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001) num_epochs = 10 inputs = torch.randn(64, 3, 32, 32) labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (64,)) # Train the model for epoch in range(num_epochs): # Forward propagation outputs = model(inputs) loss = criterion(outputs, labels) # Backward propagation and optimization optimizer.zero_grad() loss.backward() optimizer.step() # Print the training process if (epoch + 1) % 2 == 0: print(\u0026#39;Epoch [{}/{}], Loss: {:.4f}\u0026#39;.format(epoch + 1, num_epochs, loss.item())) # Predict with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model(inputs) _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1) print(outputs.shape) will get:\nEpoch [2/10], Loss: 2.2880 Epoch [4/10], Loss: 2.2841 Epoch [6/10], Loss: 2.2805 Epoch [8/10], Loss: 2.2769 Epoch [10/10], Loss: 2.2734 torch.Size([64, 10]) Start with torch\u0026rsquo;s example mnist (or What is torch.nn really?) is a great idea.\n","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eThis is a quick introduction to torch or how to build a neural network without writing the source code.

We are taking some measures, but they are probably not enough:\nThe co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, recently talked about regulation for the use of ChatGPT in Wikipedia in this podcast episode with Lex Fridman. I really like the part where he said that you, the person, should always be the last barrier.\nYes, for Wikipedia, you should do the fact check, and for code, you should run it on your computer.

Because the latter one would compile as \u0026ldquo;$,$\u0026rdquo;.)\n§2.1.2 Number and Series Number Always use \\( \\) for number. For example: There are $24$ elements in total.\nThere are \\(24\\) elements in total. And for series number, for example: This is the $n^{\\textrm{th}}$ element.\nThis is the \\(n^{\\textrm{th}}\\) element. §2.1.3 Unit Use \\, between number and unit. Use \\mathrm{} for the unit. For example: $3 \\times 10^8 \\space \\mathrm{m/s}$\n\\(3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\\) §2.1.4 Integral \\mathrm{d} x for $\\mathrm{d} x$. \\, before $\\mathrm{d}x$. \\! between $\\int$ and what\u0026rsquo;s to be intergraded.

After a capital Letter, the \u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo; would be considered in the middle of a name, for example: \u0026ldquo;F. Scott Fitzgerald\u0026rdquo;. But sometimes we don\u0026rsquo;t want that, for example: \u0026ldquo;Then I asked ChatGPT.

I like workspaces and double link feature.\n§1 General Markdown Guide is good as a quick introduction.\nThe thing about Markdown style is that every text editor has its own accent. I suggest using the universal ones, not the ones that a certain text editor created. Also, the best way to read this article is to copy and paste what\u0026rsquo;s in the code block, and see if it fits your text editor.\n§2 This and That §2.1 Use Blank Lines! Wrong:\nuse blank lines! use blank lines! Correct:\nuse blank lines! use blank lines! See Let Your Markdown Breathe! - Remember to insert blank lines between different Markdown elements.\n§2.2 Only Use _ for Bold and Italic Bold _and_ Italic Bold __and__ Italic Bold ___and___ Italic §2.3 In the Middle of a Sentence, use * for Bold and Italic Bold*and*Italic Bold**and**Italic Bold***and***Italic But to tell you the truth, I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen anyone write like this.\n§2.4 Only use - for Unordered Lists As I said, there are a lot of Markdown accent, but - is universal. Also, this is in agreement with §2.2, so that you can only use the -/_ key on the keyboard.\n- unordered lists §2.5 Four Spaces in Lists This is a fun coincidence with Python.\n- First paragraph Still first paragraph - Second paragraph Or:\n1. First paragraph Still first paragraph 2. Second paragraph To do list too:\n- [ ] hurry - [ ] up, - [ ] now! §2.6 Quote and Code Block in List Again, four spaces. But in Obsidian, these are shown correct in reading mode, shown werid in editing mode. See Code blocks nested in lists render in editor as if at top-level.\n- Quote: \u0026gt;This is the quote. - Code Block: ```python x = x + 1 ``` By the way, when you write verbatim text that contains three backticks (ie. code block in code block), you have to use four backticks to wrap the text. See The Two Surprisingly Hard Things about the Otherwise Simple Markdown - Writing three backticks verbatim, and understanding nested lists.\n§2.7 Equations Different Markdown accent handle equations differently, see 混乱的 Markdown 世界. And for Obsidian:\n1. display equations: $$\\begin{aligned} E_0\u0026amp;=mc^2 \\\\\\ E^2\u0026amp;=(mc^2)^2+(pc)^2 \\end{aligned} \\tag{1}$$where $c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\space \\mathrm{m/s}$ 2. or inline equations: $\\vec{F} = m \\ddot{\\vec{x}}$. §2.8 Two Pictures Alignment Use table (compared with inserting html \u0026lt;\u0026gt; and all that, this is easier to read):\n|![name](link)|![name](link)| |-|-| Most text editors show the picture with modified proper size. But for some text editors, when the picture is too big, you should reduce pixel size of the picture before showing it in the table. This is the case for remark and DrSlidelove. But you can solve it by putting it in a table.\n§3 使用中文时 §3.1 空格 中英文混排中的空格和盘古之白说在英文单词两边各空一空格。我的建议是在表示代码时也是如此，例如：\n我们可以 `from scipy import interpolate` 来解决这个 interpolation 问题。 §3.2 引用诗词 如何在 Markdown 中引用诗词或歌词的引用方式在 Obsidian 可能不是最好的解决方法，可以直接每行右边没有空格，见 Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs：\n\u0026gt;缺月昏昏漏未央，一灯明灭照秋床。 \u0026gt;病身最觉风露早，归梦不知山水长。 \u0026gt;坐感岁时歌慷慨，起看天地色凄凉。 \u0026gt;鸣蝉更乱行人耳，正抱疏桐叶半黄。 但是在我的个人网站中应该每行右边两个空格：\n\u0026gt;缺月昏昏漏未央，一灯明灭照秋床。 \u0026gt;病身最觉风露早，归梦不知山水长。 \u0026gt;坐感岁时歌慷慨，起看天地色凄凉。 \u0026gt;鸣蝉更乱行人耳，正抱疏桐叶半黄。 才能显示正确：\n缺月昏昏漏未央，一灯明灭照秋床。\n病身最觉风露早，归梦不知山水长。\n坐感岁时歌慷慨，起看天地色凄凉。\n鸣蝉更乱行人耳，正抱疏桐叶半黄。\n","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is, I recommend you should just play with it and don\u0026rsquo;t care about the style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md/\"\u003eObsidian\u003c/a\u003e is the text editor that I\u0026rsquo;m using.

You can manage different packages in different environments with Anaconda.\nThis article is about what I find interesting in PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code1, PEP 257 – Docstring Conventions, Style guide — numpydoc v1.6.0rc1.dev0 Manual and SPT3G. This is not a guide, I recommend Google Style Guides2 as the guide.\n§1 General Readability counts. — PEP 20\nAlways break your code apart by defining functions, classes, or create a new .py file and from myproject.backend.hgwells import time_machine. Don\u0026rsquo;t write code like a long staircase of indentation, that would drive people crazy. Comments are of equal importance as code. It\u0026rsquo;s for your own good, because you can\u0026rsquo;t remember everything. §2 This and That If your project has a style guide already, always follow that rather than this one.\n§2.1 Naming Naming is a big deal, the biggest probably. And I generally follow these rules from SPT3G.\nFunction, Variable: lower_with_under Class: CapWords Constant: CAPS_WITH_UNDER, and use scipy.constants. Non-public class methods and instance variables should begin with a single underscore (this is baked into the way python implements classes). See this table for the full naming convention.\n§2.2 Four Spaces for Indentation Also according to SPT3G:\nCONSTANT_VALUE = 10 def function_name(variable_name, other): do_some_things class MyClass: CONSTANCE_INSTANCE_VARIABLE = 100 def __init__(self, input, other_input): self.instance_variable = input + other_input def class_method(self, input): do_things §2.3 Comments and Doc Strings You should assume the person who is reading the comments are more familiar with python than you, they just don\u0026rsquo;t understand what your code is doing:\n# wrong: x = x + 1 # Increment x # correct: x = x + 1 # Compensate for border Also according to SPT3G, for classes, modules and functions, write doc strings:\ndef get_fft_scale_fac(res=None, n1=None, n2=None, apod_mask=None, parent=None): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Returns a scale factor to convert a 2d fft of a map into sqrt(C_l) normalized units by scaling it by the sky area. In particular it returns: np.mean(apod_mask**2)**0.5 * (n1 * n2)**0.5 / reso_rad For forward transforms: fft2(mp) / scale_fac For inverse transforms: ifft2(mp) * scale_fac Arguments --------- res : float, default=None Resolution of the map in G3Units. Must be specified if parent is None. n1 : int, default=None Number of map pixels in x direction. Must be specified if parent is None. n2 : int, default=None Number of map pixels in y direction. Must be specified if parent is None. apod_mask : FlatSkyMap or ndarray, default=None An apodization mask. parent : FlatSkyMap, default=None Parent Map object containing resolution and shape info. Must be specified if res, n1, and n2 are None. Returns ------- float FFT normalization factor See Also ------- ft_to_map \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; By the way, ' and \u0026quot; are the same thing in code.\n§2.4 Maximum Line Length is 80 Characters If you need to wrap multiple lines, you should wrap them on the same level of syntax structure:\nbridgekeeper.answer( name=\u0026#34;Arthur\u0026#34;, quest=questlib.find(owner=\u0026#34;Arthur\u0026#34;, perilous=True)) answer = (a_long_line().of_chained_methods() .that_eventually_provides().an_answer()) if ( config is None or \u0026#39;editor.language\u0026#39; not in config or config[\u0026#39;editor.language\u0026#39;].use_spaces is False ): use_tabs() And follow the tradition from mathematics:\nincome = (gross_wages + taxable_interest + (dividends - qualified_dividends) - ira_deduction - student_loan_interest) §2.5 Import Order Python future import statements. Python standard library imports. Third-party module or package imports. Code repository sub-package. Absolute imports are recommended.

After v7.0.0a, v7.0.0b and so on, v7.0.1 is released on 31 July 2023. What I like best about Jupyter Notebook 7 is Table of Content, few buttons on the upper-right of each notebook block, and the Visual Debugger that can run code line by line and show variables.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s worth mentioning is that installing Jupyter Notebook 7 will install JupyterLab too, so you might as well just install JupyterLab.\nSince the base environment of Miniconda is kind of empty, you can install Jupyter Notebook on a new environment.\nconda create -n jupyter activate jupyter pip install notebook Open Jupyter Notebook:\nactivate jupyter jupyter notebook After this, there should be a jupyter-notebook.exe file in .\\miniconda3\\envs\\jupyter\\Scripts folder. Now run\njupyter notebook --generate-config You will see a jupyter_notebook_config.py file in C:\\Users\\yourUserName\\.jupyter folder. Then find this line:\n# c.ServerApp.notebook_dir = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; Change this line into:\nc.ServerApp.notebook_dir = \u0026#39;C:\\Folder\\You\\Like\u0026#39; Next time you can double click jupyter-notebook.exe and it will open Jupyter Notebook in C:\\Folder\\You\\Like folder. Now you can create a start menu shortcut for this .exe file or something. (And there should be a jupyter-lab.exe in the .\\miniconda3\\envs\\jupyter\\Scripts folder, you can open it as well.)\nIf you want to change to other environments such as envName when using Jupyter Notebook:\nconda activate jupyter conda install nb_conda_kernels conda activate envName conda install ipykernel python -m ipykernel install --user --name=envName Delete the envName environment in Jupyter Notebook:\nconda activate jupyter jupyter kernelspec uninstall envName convert notebook.ipynb to .py:\njupyter nbconvert --to python notebook.ipynb ","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eThis article is a quick guidance to use Anaconda \u0026amp; Miniconda on Windows.

I have read about them in several textbooks, but when these clues forming a linear process, it\u0026rsquo;s something else. (I will come back to this \u0026ldquo;linear process\u0026rdquo; later in §2.) Here\u0026rsquo;s something interesting to me in these chapters.\nThe restrictions of human eyes: (1) wavelength: $380\u0026ndash;700 \\space \\mathrm{nm}$. (2) $220 \\space \\mathrm{frames/s}$ or maybe higher, see FPS : Human eye can see how many frames per second?. The piano metaphor, that the full spectrum of light of different wavelength is like the full notes on a piano with only one note that human can hear/see, is beautiful. I have an analogue of that metaphor myself, consider a guitar, this time the wavelength can go to infinity, since $f_n=nv/2L$1. But does the frequency of light reach infinity? Theoretically there is no such limit, but in practice we haven\u0026rsquo;t observe it. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t travel to earth or it would just pass through us. Well, according to GZK limit, there is a limit for protons, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know about photons. A Tediously Accurate Map of the Solar System feels like the rolling credit for a movie which is about how human can never leave the Solar System. Cosmic Background Explorer is legendary! It\u0026rsquo;s shocking that Ron Howard did not make a movie about it. I have always known the cover of Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division is a pulsar, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t know it\u0026rsquo;s CP1919 (Cambridge Pulsar). See the picture below. The fact that this pulsar was discovered in the UK is probably why they chose it as the cover. See, I told you the origin of Rock\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;Roll is not America. :D The person who coined the term \u0026ldquo;the Big Bang\u0026rdquo; on BBC radio (as a rejection of the Big Bang), Fred Hoyle, is also the person who came up with the idea of Triple-alpha process, which is the formation of carbon in stars. And carbon is what makes life on earth. §2 Dark Matter Thanks to the effort that the author put to make a linear process out of history, chapter 7 is amazing. It totally worth the effort mentioned in the final chapter. And it\u0026rsquo;s probably the best detective novel ever, since murder is kind of boring compared to all these twists and turns:\nThe speculation of Dark Matter is historical. We calculated there\u0026rsquo;s a planet Neptune because Uranus moves a little odd according to Newton\u0026rsquo;s law. And these evidences suggests that there are a lot more material that we can\u0026rsquo;t observe in the universe: (1) speedy galaxy clusters, (2) fast-rotating galaxies, (3) gravitational lensing. However, could it be that we understand Gravity wrong? Since Mercury precession used to be wrongly explained until General Relativity. And we proposed two possible theory: (1) MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics fudge factor), (2) TeVeS (tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory). \u0026ldquo;The Bullet Cluster, \u0026hellip; , turns out to be the perfect arena for pitting dark matter and MOND against each other.\u0026rdquo; Due to a difference in cross section, which means that dark matter has a small cross section and stars, gas have a big cross section, Dark Matter stays.2 So what is Dark Matter? It could be MACHO (MAssive Compact Halo Object), which was later ruled out. It could be WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle), which has to be (1) non-baryonic in the Standard Model, (2) weakly interacting, meaning that only Gravity and Weak Nuclear Force are possible. The author didn\u0026rsquo;t point it out, but the murderer is probably neutrino.3 See Sterile neutrino. I later found out that Interpreting Reactor Antineutrino Anomalies with STEREO data rejects this hypothesis. But the results from LSND and MiniBooNe are odd, so it\u0026rsquo;s kind of suspicious.4 Anyway, the murderer is still out there, you kids should watch out.\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is also an evidence of Dark Matter, see Microwave background observations. You can calculate the percentage of Dark Matter from the power spectrum of CMB:\n§3 More In chapter 8, the author talked about LIGO mission, which is another detective novel. The fact that a observatory has a secret supervision team that inserts false signal is a triumph of humanity, unironically. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like after the failure of Hitomi, a more organized team for XRISM is created. See Detailed Design of the Science Operations for the XRISM mission. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say these are the best solutions, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing that we\u0026rsquo;re trying. The detector itself has all kinds of flaws, but team management is actually the biggest engineering challenge.\nIn chapter 9, the author said that the final destination of our universe is a battle between ice (the Big Chill) and fire (the Big Crunch). I am curious if this is a A Song of Ice and Fire reference. Also, Dark Energy has nothing to do with Dark Matter. Dark Energy is basically just $\\Lambda$ constant.\nAnd in the final chapter, Conclusion: The complete picture: visible and invisible, what the author is trying to say is that we should be multi-messenger astronomer these days.

And I want to do better, maybe her book will help.\n§1 Beauty So there is this basic conflict between beauty and resources, where beauty means the standard we use to judge whether a theory is good or not, while resources means money, time, energy, etc. The latter one is something we cannot avoid, but the first one is something we can change, and I truly hope so.\nTo be more clear, beauty means:\nSimplicity, or Occam\u0026rsquo;s razor. \u0026ldquo;This-has-to-be-it\u0026rdquo;. The E8 Group is the largest and most complicated group of exceptional Lie Groups. And in the paper An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything, Antony Garrett Lisi uses it to, well, explain everything. Alas, this is not \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;There-must-be-one-theory-to-rule-them-all\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;There is a consistency in everything and thus it can be explained by one theory.\u0026rdquo; I suppose Chaos theory is a good counterpoint. \u0026ldquo;Smaller-means-simpler\u0026rdquo;. From the perspective of biology to chemistry to particle physics, the structure gets simpler and simpler, so it is natural to assume that it would get even simpler when it gets even smaller. But Sabine pointed out that when you start from a different scale, ie. from the universe to life on earth, it gets more complicated.1 etc. A perfectly beautiful example of beauty would be the equation (7.2-4) of Group Theory in Physics: $$ {(J_k)^{l}}_m = - i \\varepsilon _{klm} $$.2 If you learned about Linear Algebra or Group Theory, you will be amazed by the simplicity of this equation, that\u0026rsquo;s why sometimes we can\u0026rsquo;t resist the allure.\nSabine also pointed out that the idea of beauty is constantly changing. (At least I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure her idea of beauty has changed a lot since 2006, see The Beauty of it All.) For example, we used to consider an elliptical orbit as ugly. (To be honest, I suppose most people still do.) Thus it can\u0026rsquo;t be used as a guidance. I agree with Feynman that we should look for the truth no matter whether there is an ultimate truth or it\u0026rsquo;s like onions with multiple layers. But what is the guidance then? Beauty is probably not.\nAnd Sabine thinks that consistency is a possible guidance, but I must admit I am confused that (1) consistency is also a kind of beauty and (2) the biggest problem we have today is that we are lack of consistency in different disciplines due to emergence3.\n§2 Bias The word \u0026ldquo;bias\u0026rdquo; does not sound comfortable, and I believe most of the time most of people mean well. I\u0026rsquo;m not accusing anybody, it\u0026rsquo;s just that we can learn from the past. Talking about it will probably make it better, while not talking about it will definitely not make it better.\nTo be more clear, here are some typical (cognitive and social) biases listed by Sabine:\nAesthetic Bias. Which is pretty much the same as \u0026ldquo;beauty\u0026rdquo;. Social Desirability Bias. \u0026ldquo;We are, for example, more likely to put forward opinions that we believe will be well received by others.\u0026rdquo; (Which is kind of like peer pressure, speaking of which, I happen to know a book teaching you how to survive that: A PhD is not enough.) Attentional Bias (or The Mere Exposure Effect). \u0026ldquo;Research shows we consider a statement more likely to be true the more often we hear of it.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;We tend to overestimate how many other people agree with us and how much they do so.\u0026rdquo; Statistical Bias. Which is a type of error in statistical analysis where the results are systematically skewed away from the true value of the population parameter that is being estimated. Confirmation Bias. \u0026ldquo;If you search the literature for support of your argument, there it is. If you look for a mistake because your result didn’t match your expectations, there it is.\u0026rdquo; In-Group Bias. Which \u0026ldquo;makes us think researchers in our own field are more intelligent than others.\u0026rdquo; Shared Information Bias. Which \u0026ldquo;is why we keep discussing what everyone knows but fail to pay attention to information held only by a few people.\u0026rdquo; Apophenia. \u0026ldquo;We like to discover patterns in noise.\u0026rdquo; Belief Bias. \u0026ldquo;We think arguments are stronger if the conclusion seems plausible.\u0026rdquo; The mother of all biases, The Bias Blind Spot. Which is \u0026ldquo;the insistence that we certainly are not biased.\u0026rdquo; Status Quo Bias. Which is the preference for maintaining one\u0026rsquo;s current situation and opposing actions that may change the state of affairs. Boy oh boy, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot! And I hope by attentional bias, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned something. :D\n§2.1 Difference in two measurements In the book Sabine gives us an example of how two labs constantly give contradictory results when measuring the mass of a particle.\nWell, in astronomy, sadly, there is also this kind of stuff, it happened when measuring the $H_0$ constant. The picture below, presented with Dr. Matt Bothwell\u0026rsquo;s permission, is used in a course taught by him, in the summer of 2022.\nAlthough\nThe connection of the first red dot and the first blue dot is suspicious. This division for about 17 years is probably a lack of communication. The big jump in about 1987 shows a bit of sign of Social Desirability Bias. , technically I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t called it the result of bias, because:\nIt could be and is mostly likely the result of different measurements in equipment, operations, calculations, etc. This is still an open question. It is possible that the difference between two measurements is a sign of new science. See Fig. 5 of Constraints on the Hubble constant from Supernova Refsdal\u0026rsquo;s reappearance. Notice the magnitude of $H_0$ in that paper is not the same as the picture above. §3 More There are many more solid points like these in the book, and it always blows my mind or makes me laugh so hard, just like her YouTube videos, for example, What is \u0026ldquo;Nothing\u0026rdquo;?.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, I truly appreciate her honesty and bravery. It takes a lot of guts to say what thousands of people are doing is doubtful, after all it\u0026rsquo;s their job, and criticizing it will definitely get negative feedbacks, some of which will be personal and hurtful. But I think this Satre-Camus thing is something we should avoid. She means well and criticism is good for your work anyway, so let\u0026rsquo;s just focus on the work rather than fighting. That being said, she knows clearly that she is almost exclusively going to face a witch hunt after writing this book, but this is her true feelings after decades of research on physics. And there is that.\nI think I have refound what got me into physics in the first place, though I can\u0026rsquo;t tell what it is exactly.

The table below is largely inspired by this meme:\nElements There Will Be Blood A Brighter Summer Day Evangelion man vs. nature the first scene where he digs illness shito man vs. man his colleagues and counter companies those of his schoolmates who are richer, teacher anybody around him really man vs. society villagers, church school class man vs. god his conflict with the church Chinese people don\u0026rsquo;t actually believe in god shito is kind of like nature-god man vs. author (meta) Daniel and Paul use their real name. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m finished\u0026rdquo; Zhang Zhen uses his real name and real father TV episode 25,26 father-son conflict $\\checkmark$ $\\checkmark$ $\\checkmark$ attitude towards human interraction \u0026ldquo;I want to earn enough money I can get away from everyone\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m like the world, it will never change\u0026rdquo; Hedgehog\u0026rsquo;s dilemma the music is odd weird, vampire music soft songs with brutal scenes the doom is inevitable Captalism in early 20th century family background, tri-state area Dead Sea Scorlls the doom started with the death of one of the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s closest friends his son is dead to him Honey Kaworu at the end the protagonist murdered someone the degenerate godfather his girlfriend the entire humanity I am not systematically trained in films, and all my knowledge is from random places, so maybe there isn\u0026rsquo;t such a similarity, it\u0026rsquo;s just that all good stuff have these points in common. Although the 5 \u0026ldquo;vs.\u0026ldquo;s may be universal, the latter ones are not universal, I guess.\nThis article is currently unfinished, maybe these works have something in common in storyline, composition, etc. But I\u0026rsquo;ll need a rewatch to remind myself.
