I have read about them in several textbooks, but when these clues forming a linear process, it&rsquo;s something else. (I will come back to this &ldquo;linear process&rdquo; later in §2.) Here&rsquo;s something interesting to me in these chapters.</p><ul><li>The restrictions of human eyes: (1) wavelength: $380&ndash;700 \space \text{nm}$. (2) $220 \space \text{frames/s}$ or maybe higher, see <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/myvracelog/fps-human-eye-can-see-how-many-frames-per-second><em>FPS : Human eye can see how many frames per second?</em></a>.</li><li>The piano metaphor, that the full spectrum of light of different wavelength is like the full notes on a piano with only one note that human can hear/see, is beautiful. I have an analogue of that metaphor myself, consider a guitar, this time the wavelength can go to infinity, since $f_n=nv/2L$<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. But does the frequency of light reach infinity? Theoretically there is no such limit, but in practice we haven&rsquo;t observe it. It wouldn&rsquo;t travel to earth or it would just pass through us. Well, according to GZK limit, there is a limit for protons, but I don&rsquo;t know about photons.</li><li><a href=https://joshworth.com/a-tediously-accurate-map-of-the-solar-system/><em>A Tediously Accurate Map of the Solar System</em></a> feels like the rolling credit for a movie which is about how human can never leave the Solar System.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer>Cosmic Background Explorer</a> is legendary! It&rsquo;s shocking that Ron Howard did not make a movie about it.</li><li>I have always known the cover of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures><em>Unknown Pleasures</em></a> by Joy Division is a pulsar, but I didn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1919%2B21>CP1919 (Cambridge Pulsar)</a>. See the picture below. The fact that this pulsar was discovered in the UK is probably why they chose it as the cover. See, I told you the origin of Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;Roll is not America. :D</li><li>The person who <a href=broadcasthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle#Rejection_of_the_Big_Bang>coined the term &ldquo;the Big Bang&rdquo; on BBC radio</a> (as a rejection of the Big Bang), Fred Hoyle, is also the person who came up with the idea of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process>Triple-alpha process</a>, which is the formation of carbon in stars. And carbon is what makes life on earth.</li></ul><p><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5a/UnknownPleasuresVinyl.jpg alt=UnknownPleasuresVinyl loading=lazy decoding=async class=full-width></p><h2 id=2-dark-matter>§2 Dark Matter</h2><p>Thanks to the effort that the author put to make a linear process out of history, chapter 7 is amazing. It totally worth the effort mentioned in the final chapter. And it&rsquo;s probably the best detective novel ever, since murder is kind of boring compared to all these twists and turns:</p><ol><li>The speculation of Dark Matter is historical. We calculated there&rsquo;s a planet Neptune because Uranus moves a little odd according to Newton&rsquo;s law.</li><li>And these evidences suggests that there are a lot more material that we can&rsquo;t observe in the universe: (1) speedy galaxy clusters, (2) fast-rotating galaxies, (3) gravitational lensing.</li><li>However, could it be that we understand Gravity wrong? Since Mercury precession used to be wrongly explained until General Relativity. And we proposed two possible theory: (1) MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics fudge factor), (2) TeVeS (tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory).</li><li>&ldquo;The Bullet Cluster, &mldr; , turns out to be the perfect arena for pitting dark matter and MOND against each other.&rdquo; Long story short, Dark Matter stays.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></li><li>So what is Dark Matter?</li><li>It could be MACHO (MAssive Compact Halo Object), which was later ruled out.</li><li>It could be WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle), which has to be (1) non-baryonic in the Standard Model, (2) weakly interacting, meaning that only Gravity and Weak Nuclear Force are possible.</li><li>The author didn&rsquo;t point it out, but the murderer is probably neutrino.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> See <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_neutrino>Sterile neutrino</a>. I later found out that <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07664><em>Interpreting Reactor Antineutrino Anomalies with STEREO data</em></a> rejects this hypothesis. But the results from LSND and MiniBooNe are odd, so it&rsquo;s kind of suspicious.</li></ol><p>Anyway, the murderer is still out there, you kids should watch out.</p><h2 id=3-more>§3 More</h2><p>In chapter 8, the author talked about LIGO mission, which is another detective novel. The fact that a observatory has a secret supervision team that inserts false signal is a triumph of humanity, unironically. It&rsquo;s kind of like after the failure of Hitomi, a more organized team for XRISM is created. See <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01611><em>Detailed Design of the Science Operations for the XRISM mission</em></a>. I wouldn&rsquo;t say these are the best solutions, but it&rsquo;s a good thing that we&rsquo;re trying. The detector itself has all kinds of flaws, but team management is actually the biggest engineering challenge.</p><p>In chapter 9, the author said that the final destination of our universe is a battle between ice (the Big Chill) and fire (the Big Crunch). I am curious if this is a <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> reference. Also, Dark Energy has nothing to do with Dark Matter. Dark Energy is basically just $\Lambda$ constant.</p><p>And in the final chapter, <em>Conclusion: The complete picture: visible and invisible</em>, what the author is trying to say is that we should be multi-messenger astronomer these days. Yeah, I guess with the help of ChatGPT, it&rsquo;s possible to handle all those literatures. And I am always a little sad that the Nobel-Prize-winning LIGO detection is not multi-messenger.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>See <a href=https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/strings.html><em>Strings, standing waves and harmonics</em></a>.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>The author quote that &ldquo;The &lsquo;duck test&rsquo; says that if something looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.&rdquo; Duck is somehow good for metaphor, I don&rsquo;t know why.
