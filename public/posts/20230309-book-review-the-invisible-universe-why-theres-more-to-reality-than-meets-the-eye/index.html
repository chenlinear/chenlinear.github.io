      <p>This is a review of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Universe-Theres-Reality-Meets/dp/0861541243"><em>The Invisible Universe: Why There&rsquo;s More to Reality than Meets the Eye</em></a> by <a href="https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~bothwell/">Matt Bothwell</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-astronomy-101">§1 Astronomy 101</h2>
<p>The first 6 chapters are Astronomy 101 to me. I have read about them in several textbooks, but when these clues forming a linear process, it&rsquo;s something else. (I will come back to this &ldquo;linear process&rdquo; later in §2.) Here&rsquo;s something interesting to me in these chapters.</p>
<ul>
<li>The restrictions of human eyes: (1) wavelength: $380&ndash;700 \space \mathrm{nm}$. (2) $220 \space \mathrm{frames/s}$ or maybe higher, see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myvracelog/fps-human-eye-can-see-how-many-frames-per-second"><em>FPS : Human eye can see how many frames per second?</em></a>.</li>
<li>The piano metaphor, that the full spectrum of light of different wavelength is like the full notes on a piano with only one note that human can hear/see, is beautiful. I have an analogue of that metaphor myself, consider a guitar, this time the wavelength can go to infinity, since $f_n=nv/2L$<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. But does the frequency of light reach infinity? Theoretically there is no such limit, but in practice we haven&rsquo;t observe it. It wouldn&rsquo;t travel to earth or it would just pass through us. Well, according to GZK limit, there is a limit for protons, but I don&rsquo;t know about photons.</li>
<li><a href="https://joshworth.com/a-tediously-accurate-map-of-the-solar-system/"><em>A Tediously Accurate Map of the Solar System</em></a> feels like the rolling credit for a movie which is about how human can never leave the Solar System.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer">Cosmic Background Explorer</a> is legendary! It&rsquo;s shocking that Ron Howard did not make a movie about it.</li>
<li>I have always known the cover of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures"><em>Unknown Pleasures</em></a> by Joy Division is a pulsar, but I didn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1919%2B21">CP1919 (Cambridge Pulsar)</a>. See the picture below. The fact that this pulsar was discovered in the UK is probably why they chose it as the cover. See, I told you the origin of Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;Roll is not America. :D</li>
<li>The person who <a href="broadcasthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle#Rejection_of_the_Big_Bang">coined the term &ldquo;the Big Bang&rdquo; on BBC radio</a> (as a rejection of the Big Bang), Fred Hoyle, is also the person who came up with the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process">Triple-alpha process</a>, which is the formation of carbon in stars. And carbon is what makes life on earth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-dark-matter">§2 Dark Matter</h2>
<p>Thanks to the effort that the author put to make a linear process out of history, chapter 7 is amazing. It totally worth the effort mentioned in the final chapter. And it&rsquo;s probably the best detective novel ever, since murder is kind of boring compared to all these twists and turns:</p>
<ol>
<li>The speculation of Dark Matter is historical. We calculated there&rsquo;s a planet Neptune because Uranus moves a little odd according to Newton&rsquo;s law.</li>
<li>And these evidences suggests that there are a lot more material that we can&rsquo;t observe in the universe: (1) speedy galaxy clusters, (2) fast-rotating galaxies, (3) gravitational lensing.</li>
<li>However, could it be that we understand Gravity wrong? Since Mercury precession used to be wrongly explained until General Relativity. And we proposed two possible theory: (1) MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics fudge factor), (2) TeVeS (tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory).</li>
<li>&ldquo;The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster">Bullet Cluster</a>, &hellip; , turns out to be the perfect arena for pitting dark matter and MOND against each other.&rdquo; Due to a difference in cross section, which means that dark matter has a small cross section and stars, gas have a big cross section, Dark Matter stays.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>

  decoding="async"
  class="full-width"
/>

</li>
<li>So what is Dark Matter?</li>
<li>It could be MACHO (MAssive Compact Halo Object), which was later ruled out.</li>
<li>It could be WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle), which has to be (1) non-baryonic in the Standard Model, (2) weakly interacting, meaning that only Gravity and Weak Nuclear Force are possible.</li>
<li>The author didn&rsquo;t point it out, but the murderer is probably neutrino.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_neutrino">Sterile neutrino</a>. I later found out that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07664"><em>Interpreting Reactor Antineutrino Anomalies with STEREO data</em></a> rejects this hypothesis. But the results from LSND and MiniBooNe are odd, so it&rsquo;s kind of suspicious.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, the murderer is still out there, you kids should watch out.</p>
<p>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is also an evidence of Dark Matter, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Microwave_background_observations">Microwave background observations</a>. You can calculate the percentage of Dark Matter from the power spectrum of CMB:</p>

</p>
<h2 id="3-more">§3 More</h2>
<p>In chapter 8, the author talked about LIGO mission, which is another detective novel. The fact that a observatory has a secret supervision team that inserts false signal is a triumph of humanity, unironically. It&rsquo;s kind of like after the failure of Hitomi, a more organized team for XRISM is created. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01611"><em>Detailed Design of the Science Operations for the XRISM mission</em></a>. I wouldn&rsquo;t say these are the best solutions, but it&rsquo;s a good thing that we&rsquo;re trying. The detector itself has all kinds of flaws, but team management is actually the biggest engineering challenge.</p>
<p>In chapter 9, the author said that the final destination of our universe is a battle between ice (the Big Chill) and fire (the Big Crunch). I am curious if this is a <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> reference. Also, Dark Energy has nothing to do with Dark Matter. Dark Energy is basically just $\Lambda$ constant.</p>
<p>And in the final chapter, <em>Conclusion: The complete picture: visible and invisible</em>, what the author is trying to say is that we should be multi-messenger astronomer these days. Yeah, I guess with the help of ChatGPT, it&rsquo;s possible to handle all those literatures. And I am always a little sad that the Nobel-Prize-winning LIGO detection is not multi-messenger.</p>

<p>The author quote that &ldquo;The &lsquo;duck test&rsquo; says that if something looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.&rdquo; Duck is somehow good for metaphor, I don&rsquo;t know why. I later wrote about the Duck-Rabbit picture in  <a href="https://chenlinear.github.io/posts/20230406-book-review-existential-physics-a-scientists-guide-to-lifes-biggest-questions/"><em>Book review: Existential Physics: A Scientist&rsquo;s Guide to Life&rsquo;s Biggest Questions</em></a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The moment this came to my head is memorable. It was on a train, and I was listening to <em>Ti Amo</em> by Laura Branigan. After reading <a href="https://chenlinear.github.io/posts/20230501-book-review-love-and-math-the-heart-of-hidden-reality/"><em>Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality</em></a> by Edward Frenkel, I found out that he also had this kind of &ldquo;Eureka&rdquo; moment on a train. His idea is true, while mine still needs to be tested by experiment.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:4">
<p>I later got in touch with the author, and it is recommended to read this review article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07938"><em>Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</em></a>. Thanks for his help!&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
