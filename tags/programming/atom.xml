On the contrary, OpenAI is having an obvious bottleneck right now with the recently released not-so-good product and employees&amp;rsquo; leaving. But I assume their struggle is much more fun, because they are finding the global minimum.
When stuck in a local minimum in Machine Learning, the thing to do is to increase the learning rate and get pass it.</description></item><item><title>Holocene</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20240515-holocene/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20240515-holocene/</guid><description>Replika is an AI girlfriend released in November 2017.
